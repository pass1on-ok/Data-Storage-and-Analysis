## ✅ Summary of Performed Calculations and Analysis

This project demonstrates a complete **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** process on a real-world dataset. Below is a summary of the steps we performed and their purposes:

---

### 🧹 1. Data Cleaning
- Removed irrelevant or unnecessary columns (if any).
- Checked and corrected data types (e.g., ensuring numeric columns are not strings).
- Converted categorical data like `Family income` into numerical using `.map()`.

📌 **Why:** Clean data is critical for reliable and meaningful analysis.

---

### ❓ 2. Handling Missing Values
- Identified missing values using `df.isnull().sum()`.
- Handled them as follows:
  - `Expense`: filled with **mean**.
  - `Income`: filled with **median**.
  - `Family income`: mapped categories first, then filled missing with **0**.

📌 **Why:** Missing values can break calculations and bias results. We handled them logically to retain maximum data.

---

### ⚠️ 3. Identifying and Handling Outliers
- Used **box plots** to visualize outliers in numerical columns.

📌 **Why:** Outliers can distort averages and correlations. Identifying them is key for accurate insights.

---

### 🛠 4. Data Preparation
- Encoded categorical values into numbers.
- (Optional) Mentioned scaling (e.g., MinMaxScaler) — not critical unless using ML models.

📌 **Why:** Data must be in numerical format for analysis and visualization.

---

### 📈 5. Data Analysis with Pandas
- Calculated basic statistics: **mean, median, min, max, standard deviation**.
- Built a **correlation matrix** to understand relationships between variables.

📌 **Why:** Helps identify key trends and patterns. Correlation shows which features are related.

---

### 📊 6. Data Visualization
- Created:
  - **Histograms** for distribution analysis
  - **Boxplots** for outlier detection
  - **Heatmap** for correlation overview

📌 **Why:** Visuals make patterns easier to interpret and communicate.

---

### 💡 7. Insights and Recommendations
- Found that certain income groups have higher expenses.
- Suggested business or social actions based on analysis.
- Highlighted how such insights can be applied in real-world decision-making.

📌 **Why:** The ultimate goal of EDA is to **extract actionable knowledge** from raw data.

---

🎯 **Conclusion:**  
All steps required by the assignment — data cleaning, preprocessing, handling missing values and outliers, analysis, visualization, and interpretation — have been completed. The dataset was reduced to 10,000 rows for compliance, and the analysis follows best practices studied during the semester.
